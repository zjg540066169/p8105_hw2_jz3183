# Homework 2 for Data Science Course p8105

This is an R Markdown document for homework 2 in course p8105. The author is Jungang Zou whose UNI is jz3183.

## Problem 1

In the first problem, I need to clean the Mr.Trash Wheel sheet at first. In the following chunk, I need to read the excel file and do some data cleaning.

```{r df_trash_wheel_create, collapse = TRUE, message = FALSE}
# read the data frame from excel file on sheet named "Mr. Trash Wheel"
df_trash_wheel = 
  #read data from excel file
  read_excel('./Data_Problem_1/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx', sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", skip = 1) %>% 
  
  #delete the last columns containing notes
  select(-...15, -...16, -...17) %>% 
  
  #clean columns` names
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  
  #delete the rows that do not include dumpster-specific data
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  
  #round the number of sports balls to the nearest integer and converts the result to an integer variable
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls, 0)))
  
# display the data frame
df_trash_wheel
```

After I have read the sheet named "Mr. Trash Wheel", I need to read and clean precipitation data for 2017 and 2018. In the following chunk, I need to read data from different the excel sheets and do some data cleaning.


```{r df_precipitation_create, collapse = TRUE}
# read the data frame from excel file on sheet named "2017 Precipitation" and "2018 Precipitation".

df_precipitation_2017 = 
  #read the data on on sheet named "2017 Precipitation" from excel file
  read_excel('./Data_Problem_1/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx', sheet = "2017 Precipitation", skip = 1) %>% 
  
  #clean columns` names
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  
  #clean up the rows with  Na.
  drop_na() %>% 
  
  #add the year variable
  mutate(year = "2017")


df_precipitation_2018 = 
  #read the data on on sheet named "2018 Precipitation" from excel file
  read_excel('./Data_Problem_1/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx', sheet = "2018 Precipitation", skip = 1) %>% 
  
  #clean columns` names
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  
  #clean up the rows with  Na.
  drop_na() %>% 
  
  #add the year variable
  mutate(year = "2018")

#combine precipitation datasets and convert month to a character variable

df_precipitation = 
  #combine 2 datasets by binding the rows.
  bind_rows(df_precipitation_2017, df_precipitation_2018) %>% 
  
  #convert month to a character variable by using month.name
  mutate(month = month.name[month])

# display the data frame
df_precipitation
```

Finally, I need to write a paragraph about the data. As we know, there are totally 2 resulting dataframes named "df_trash_wheel" and "df_precipitation". 

&nbsp;

For the dataframe named "df_trash_wheel", there are totally `r nrow(df_trash_wheel)` observations and `r ncol(df_trash_wheel)` variables. To show the key variables, we will first show the names of key variables: `r colnames(df_trash_wheel)[1:6]`. The first variable `r colnames(df_trash_wheel)[1]` is a key for each observation. The 3 variables `r colnames(df_trash_wheel)[2:4]` show the time of each observation, and the 2 variables `r colnames(df_trash_wheel)[5:6]` which indicate the amount of trash in each observation.

&nbsp;

For the dataframe named "df_precipitation", there are totally `r nrow(df_precipitation)` observations and `r ncol(df_precipitation)` variables. To show the key variables, we will first show the names of key variables: `r colnames(df_precipitation)[1:3]`. The first variable `r colnames(df_precipitation)[c(1,3)]` is the date for each observation. The variables `r colnames(df_precipitation)[2]` show the precipitation of each observation.


&nbsp;

In addition, for 2 dataframes "df_precipitation_2017" and "df_precipitation_2018", there are totally `r nrow(df_precipitation_2017)` observations and `r ncol(df_precipitation_2017)` variables in "df_precipitation_2017", and `r nrow(df_precipitation_2018)` observations and `r ncol(df_precipitation_2018)` variables in "df_precipitation_2018". To show the key variables, we will first show the names of key variables: `r colnames(df_precipitation)[1:3]`. The first variable `r colnames(df_precipitation)[c(1,3)]` is the date for each observation. The variables `r colnames(df_precipitation)[2]` show the precipitation of each observation.


&nbsp;

In 2018, the total precipitation is `r sum(pull(df_precipitation[pull(df_precipitation, year) == 2018,], total))`. In 2017, the median number of sports balls in a dumpster is `r median(pull(df_trash_wheel[pull(df_trash_wheel, year) == 2017,], sports_balls))`.



## Problem 2

In the second problem, I need to clean the 3 dataset. In the following chunk, I will read three excel files in a folder and do some data cleaning.

```{r df_five_thirty_eight_create, collapse = TRUE, message = FALSE}
# read the data frame from excel file in folder named "fivethirtyeight_datasets".
df_pols_month = 
  #read data
  read_csv('./Data_Problem_2/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv') %>% 
  
  #clean names
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  
  #separate variable "mon" into 3 columns
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") %>% 
  
  #change month into the character of month.name
  mutate(month = month.name[as.integer(month)]) %>% 
  
  #set variable "president"
  pivot_longer(
    c(prez_gop, prez_dem),
    names_to = "president", 
    values_to = "president_value",
    names_prefix = "prez_"
  ) %>% 
  
  #delete the row whose value which is 0
  filter(president_value != 0) %>% 
  
  #delete 2 columns
  select(-president_value, -day)
  



df_snp = 
  #read data
  read_csv('./Data_Problem_2/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv') %>% 
  
  #clean names
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  
  #separate variable "date" into 3 columns
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year"), sep = "/") %>% 
  
  #sort date
  arrange(year, month) %>% 
  
  #change month into the character of month.name
  mutate(month = month.name[as.integer(month)]) %>%
  
  #set variable "year", "month" at first and delete variable "day"
  select(year, month, everything(), -day)




df_unemployment = 
  #read data
  read_csv('./Data_Problem_2/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv') %>% 
  
  #clean names
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  
  #change variable "year" as character
  mutate(year = as.character(year)) %>% 
  
  #spread month data to month columns
  pivot_longer(
    jan:dec,
    names_to = "month", 
    values_to = "percentage_of_unemployment"
  ) %>% 
  
  #change the "month" variable to month.name with first capital letter.
  mutate(month = str_subset(month.name, str_to_sentence(month)))

  
# display the data frame
df_pols_month


df_snp


df_unemployment 
```

After data cleaning, I will merge the 3 different dataframe into one.

```{r df_merge_create, collapse = TRUE}
# Join the datasets by merging df_snp into df_pols_month, and merging df_unemployment into the result.
df_merge = 
  left_join(df_pols_month, df_snp, by = c("year", "month")) %>% 
  left_join(., df_unemployment, by = c("year", "month"))


#display the dataframe
df_merge
```

Finally, I will write a short paragraph to explain 4 datasets above briefly.

&nbsp;

Dataset "df_pols_month" contains the data about national politicians who are democratic or republican at any given time. The resulting dataset contains totally `r nrow(df_pols_month)` observations and `r ncol(df_pols_month)` variables: 

* year, month: 2 key variables, the date of count, range from `r pull(df_pols_month, month)[1]`, `r pull(df_pols_month, year)[1]` to `r pull(df_pols_month, month)[nrow(df_pols_month)]`, `r pull(df_pols_month, year)[nrow(df_pols_month)]`.
* gov_gop: the number of republican governors on the associated date.
* sen_gop: the number of republican senators on the associated date.
* rep_gop: the number of republican representatives on the associated date.
* gov_dem: the number of democratic governors on the associated date.
* sen_dem: the number of democratic senators on the associated date.
* rep_dem: the number of democratic representatives on the associated date.
* president: key variable, indicate whether the president was republican or democratic governors.

&nbsp;

Dataset "df_snp" contains the data about Standard & Poor’s stock market index (S&P), which is a representative measure of stock market as a whole. The resulting dataset contains totally `r nrow(df_snp)` observations and `r ncol(df_snp)` variables: 

* year, month: 2 key variables, the date of count, range from `r pull(df_snp, month)[1]`, `r pull(df_snp, year)[1]` to `r pull(df_snp, month)[nrow(df_snp)]`, `r pull(df_snp, year)[nrow(df_snp)]`.
* close: key variable, the closing values of the S&P stock index on the associated date.

&nbsp;

Dataset "df_unemployment" contains the data about percentage of unemployment and date. The resulting dataset contains totally `r nrow(df_unemployment)` observations and `r ncol(df_unemployment)` variables: 

* year, month: 2 key variables, the date of count, range from `r pull(df_unemployment, month)[1]`, `r pull(df_unemployment, year)[1]` to `r pull(df_unemployment, month)[nrow(df_unemployment)]`, `r pull(df_unemployment, year)[nrow(df_unemployment)]`.
* percentage_of_unemployment: key variable, percentage of unemployment on the associated date.

&nbsp;

Dataset "df_merge" contains the data about S&P, percentage of unemployment and information about national politicians. The resulting dataset contains totally `r nrow(df_merge)` observations and `r ncol(df_merge)` variables: 

* year, month: 2 key variables, the date of count, range from `r pull(df_merge, month)[1]`, `r pull(df_merge, year)[1]` to `r pull(df_merge, month)[nrow(df_merge)]`, `r pull(df_merge, year)[nrow(df_merge)]`.
* close: key variable, the closing values of the S&P stock index on the associated date.
* percentage_of_unemployment: key variable, percentage of unemployment on the associated date.
* president: key variable, indicate whether the president was republican or democratic governors.
* gov_gop: the number of republican governors on the associated date.
* sen_gop: the number of republican senators on the associated date.
* rep_gop: the number of republican representatives on the associated date.
* gov_dem: the number of democratic governors on the associated date.
* sen_dem: the number of democratic senators on the associated date.
* rep_dem: the number of democratic representatives on the associated date.


## Problem 3

In the third problem, I need to clean the a dataset which contrains the popularity of baby names. In the following chunk, I will read excel file and do some data cleaning.

```{r df_popular_baby_names_create, collapse = TRUE, message = FALSE}
#In this chunk, we read data from excel file and do some data cleaning.

# read the data frame from excel file
df_popular_baby_names = 
  #read data
  read_csv('./Popular_Baby_Names.csv') %>% 
  
  #clean names
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  
  #mutate some childs_first_name with uppercase initial.
  mutate(childs_first_name = str_to_sentence(childs_first_name)) %>% 
  
  #clean some unconsistent data about ethnicity
  mutate(ethnicity = replace(ethnicity, ethnicity == "ASIAN AND PACI", "ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER")) %>% 
  mutate(ethnicity = replace(ethnicity, ethnicity == "BLACK NON HISP", "BLACK NON HISPANIC")) %>% 
  mutate(ethnicity = replace(ethnicity, ethnicity == "WHITE NON HISP", "WHITE NON HISPANIC")) %>%
  
  #clean the duplicate rows.
  distinct()

#display the data frame
df_popular_baby_names
```

After we clean the data, we need to well-structured, reader-friendly table to show the rank in popularity of the name “Olivia” as a female baby name over time with rows for ethnicities and columns for year. The table are drawed as follow:

&nbsp;

Rank in Popularity of 'Olivia' as a Female Baby Name Over Time
```{r df_olivia, collapse = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
#This code chunk is used to filter the data about "Olivia" and draw the table.
olivia_data = 
  #filter data with "Olivia"
  filter(df_popular_baby_names, childs_first_name == "Olivia") %>% 
  
  #gather ethnicity as rows, year_of_birth as columns and rank as value in every cell.
  pivot_wider(
    id_cols = ethnicity,
    names_from = year_of_birth, 
    values_from = rank
  )
  
#draw the table
knitr::kable(olivia_data, booktabs = TRUE)
```

Then, we need to a table to show the most popular name among male children over time.

&nbsp;

The Most Popular Name among Male Children Over Time
```{r popular_male_name, collapse = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
#This code chunk is used to filter the data about male name with rank 1 and draw the table.
popular_male_name = 
  #filter the data about male name with rank 1
  filter(df_popular_baby_names, rank == 1, gender == "MALE") %>% 
  
  #gather ethnicity as rows, year_of_birth as columns and childs_first_name as value in every cell.
  pivot_wider(
    id_cols = ethnicity,
    names_from = year_of_birth, 
    values_from = childs_first_name
  ) 

#draw the table
knitr::kable(popular_male_name, booktabs = TRUE)
```

&nbsp;

Finally, we need to draw a scatter plot to show the number of children with a name (y axis) against the rank in popularity of that name (x axis), with data about male, white non-hispanic children born in 2016.

```{r male_white_children_rank_plot, collapse = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
#In this chunk, we draw a scatter plot to show the number of children with a name (y axis) against the rank in popularity of that name (x axis), with data about male, white non-hispanic children born in 2016.

plot_data = 
  #change variables "count" and "rank" as integer
  mutate(df_popular_baby_names, count = as.integer(count), rank = as.integer(rank)) %>% 
  
  #filter the data about male, white non-hispanic children born in 2016.
  filter(year_of_birth == 2016, ethnicity == "WHITE NON HISPANIC", gender == "MALE") %>% 
  
  #keep variables "count", "rank" to draw scatter plot.
  select(count, rank) 

#draw scatter plot
scatter_plot <- 
  ggplot(plot_data) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = rank, y = count, color = rank)) + 
  labs(title = "Scatterplot of number of children with a name vs rank in popularity", x = "Rank", y = "Number of children with a name") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

scatter_plot

#save the scatterplot
ggsave("count_rank_scatterplot.pdf", scatter_plot, height = 4, width = 6)
```
