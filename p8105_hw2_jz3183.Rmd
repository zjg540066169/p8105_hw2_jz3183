# Homework 2 for Data Science Course p8105

This is an R Markdown document for homework 2 in course p8105. The author is Jungang Zou whose UNI is jz3183.

## Problem 1

```{r df_p1_create, collapse = TRUE}
# create the data frame
df_trash_wheel = read_excel('./HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx', sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", skip = 1) %>% 
  select(-...15) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls)))
  
# display the data frame
df_trash_wheel
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
